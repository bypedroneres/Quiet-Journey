<h3>✺ Quiet Journey ✺</h3>

The Quiet Journey is a meditation website designed to provide a serene and peaceful experience for users seeking relaxation and mindfulness.

<h4>✹ Goal ✹</h4>

The main objective of the Quiet Journey website is to offer a virtual space for users to engage in guided meditation sessions. The goal is to create a calming environment that helps individuals reduce stress, increase self-awareness, and promote mental well-being.

<h4>✹ Design ✹</h4>

The Quiet Journey website features a minimalist design with a focus on simplicity and tranquility. The interface utilizes soft colors, clean typography, and ample white space to create a visually soothing experience. The central element is a circle, representing a symbol of mindfulness and unity.

<h4>✹ Features ✹</h4>

* <b>Guided Meditation:</b> Users can click on the circle to start a guided meditation session. The website provides a curated script that guides users through a peaceful journey of self-reflection and relaxation.
* <b>Text Animation:</b> As the guided meditation progresses, the text lines appear one by one, creating a sense of flow and progression. Each new line replaces the previous one, allowing users to focus on the current instruction.
* <b>Minimalistic Interface:</b> The website follows a minimalistic approach, providing a distraction-free environment for meditation. By keeping the interface simple and uncluttered, users can immerse themselves in the practice without unnecessary distractions but you have to keep your eyes open.
* <b>Responsive Design:</b> The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
